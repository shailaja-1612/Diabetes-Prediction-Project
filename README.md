## Introduction

Here we will predict the Diabetes in Patients on the basis of given features. We use the Diabetes Prediction dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for the Patients Health. By the use of Machine learning model, we will predict the Diabetes.

## Machine Learning Model

Steps Involved are:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Data
- Applying different Machine Learning Models
- Evaluating the Model
- Accuracy Obtained is 78%
